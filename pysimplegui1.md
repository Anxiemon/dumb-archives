Now that this is a commercial project I've gone ahead and deleted my screenshot, as I recommend the rest of you do now as well.
We helped serve as their free lab rats and QA for years. Now that they're locking down the software, we shouldn't help them anymore.

I still use PSG occasionally for my hobby projects. I used to recommend it every chance I got but can no longer do that. PSG is regularly trashed in the Python Discord I follow when questions about it come up.
I understand the author wanting to get paid for his work but there are too many free options out there. I wish I had not invested time learning the module.

I am still using 4.60 while I search for a suitable alternative specifically due to the new licence being incompatible.
It's a shame that PSG has gone this way and a shame that the owner has tried to yank previous versions on PyPi to force people onto v5 - this is not what the yank feature exists for.

In the end that was the PSG author's choice to make. In the same way it is
my choice to no longer promote the module and like you look for the best
free alternative out there.
